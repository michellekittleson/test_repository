# Task #1

grades = [85, 90, 78, 88]
activities = ["Football", "Music", "Art", "Dance"]

student_2 = students[1], grades[1], activities[1]
student_3 = students[2], grades[2], activities[2]
student_4 = students[3], grades[3], activities[3]

# Is there a way to do this based solely on the grade?

students_approved = [students[0], students[1], students[3]]
